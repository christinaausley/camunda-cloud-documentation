## Introduction

Tasklist provides two ways for authentication:

1. Authenticate with user information stored in [Elasticsearch](#user-in-elasticsearch)
2. Authenticate via [Camunda Cloud Single Sign-On](#camunda-cloud-single-sign-on)

By default user storage in Elasticsearch is enabled.

## User in Elasticsearch

In this mode the user authenticates with username and password, that are stored in Elasticsearch.
**username** and **password** for one user may be set in application.yml:

```
zeebe.tasklist:
  username: anUser
  password: aPassword
```

On Tasklist startup the user will be created if not existed before.

By default one user with **username**/**password** `demo`/`demo` will be created.

More users can be added directly to Elasticsearch, to the index `tasklist-user-<version>_`. Password must be encoded with BCrypt strong hashing function.

## Camunda Cloud Single Sign-On

Currently Tasklist supports Single Sign On in Camunda Cloud environment. Camunda Cloud takes care of the configuration of Tasklist for Single Sign On,
so you don't need normally to adjust following subsections.

### Enable Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On may be enabled only by setting [Spring profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles): `sso-auth`

Example for setting spring profile as environmental variable:
```
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=sso-auth
```

### Configure Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On needs following parameters (all are mandatory):

Parametername |Description
--------------|-------------
zeebe.tasklist.auth0.domain | Defines the domain which the user sees
zeebe.tasklist.auth0.backendDomain | Defines the domain which provides user information
zeebe.tasklist.auth0.clientId | It's like an user name for the application
zeebe.tasklist.auth0.clientSecret | It's like a password for the application
zeebe.tasklist.auth0.claimName | The claim that will be checked by Tasklist. It's like a permission name
zeebe.tasklist.auth0.organization | The given organization should be contained in value of claim name

Example for setting parameters as environment variables:

```
export ZEEBE_TASKLIST_AUTH0_DOMAIN=A_DOMAIN
export ZEEBE_TASKLIST_AUTH0_BACKENDDOMAIN=A_BACKEND_DDOMAIN
export ZEEBE_TASKLIST_AUTH0_CLIENTID=A_CLIENT_ID
export ZEEBE_TASKLIST_AUTH0_CLIENTSECRET=A_SECRET
export ZEEBE_TASKLIST_AUTH0_CLAIMNAME=A_CLAIM
export ZEEBE_TASKLIST_AUTH0_ORGANIZATION=AN_ORGANIZATION
```
